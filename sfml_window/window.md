## images or custom shapes 
Because of simple and clean nature of game graphics 
the question unfolds:

should the images be simple 2d asset or custom colored polygon shape

| id |idea | image |polygon| 
| :---:| :---:| :---|:---|
| 1 | upload        |easy | will require a lot of work|
| 2 | saleability   |images can be scaled, but there are definitely some minimal and maximal scale factor |limitless|
| 3 | color change  | no without custom loader (or some kind of vector loader and than sprite modification)|limitless|
