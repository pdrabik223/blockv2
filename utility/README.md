# Utility

The directory contains different supporting classes 

| id | name | description |
|:---:|:---:|:---|
| 1 |[2D point](coord.h)| unified across whole project, represents point in 2d space |
| 2 |[rect](rect.h)| class representing simple rectangle |
| 3 |[transposition](transposition.h)| 1st approach to simplify game engine, the main problem with last iteration was collision handling, this (I suppose) is the answer to the collisions problem
| 4 |[gui color](../sfml_window/window_utility/gui_color.h)| nicer way to organise color change|
