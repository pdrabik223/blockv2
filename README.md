# blockv2
The second iteration of my version of logic block and automata game. 
This time (after learning a lesson), will be better 

# my mistakes

 - to complicated engine 
 - the double buffer, recursive approach to moving pieces
it was the biggest problem
 - bad gui, in console it looked good but worked only on clion console   
 - more pieces, for now 10 
 - gui allows for better user experience
 - animations
 - The style of app will be mini-metro like a.k.a. clean, simple and smart 
 - oh and the used Api will be sfml
